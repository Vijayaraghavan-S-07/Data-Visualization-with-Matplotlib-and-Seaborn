# Data-Visualization-with-Matplotlib-and-Seaborn

This Python task demonstrates how to visualize survival trends in the Titanic dataset using various types of plots. The dataset contains basic information, including PassengerId and Survived columns, and the goal of the project is to create insightful visualizations that help analyze the survival rates.

# Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is often used for beginner-level data analysis and machine learning tasks. In this project, we explore various visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze survival patterns based on the available columns.

# Features:
1. Survival Count Bar Chart: Visualizes the count of passengers who survived vs. those who didn't.
2. Scatter Plot: Plots passenger survival status as a function of PassengerId.
3. Heatmap: Displays the correlation matrix between numerical columns (if available).
4. Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of survival rates as percentages.
5. Cumulative Survival Plot: Tracks cumulative survival rates across passengers.
6. Grouped Bar Plot: Groups passengers by PassengerId ranges and visualizes survival rates in each group.
7. Density Plot: Displays the distribution of PassengerId for survivors and non-survivors.
8. Stacked Area Plot: Visualizes the survival proportion for each PassengerId over time.

# Installation
# Install dependencies: 
  If you don't have the necessary Python libraries installed, you can install them using pip:
    pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

# Dataset:
  The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset. You can download it from Kaggle: Titanic Dataset on Kaggle
  Ensure you save the dataset in the same directory as the Python script or update the file_path variable to point to the location of your dataset.
